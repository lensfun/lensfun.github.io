If your own lens or camera is not part of the database please check 
<a href="http://wilson.bronger.org/lensfun_coverage.html">daily updated list</a> of the current development version. 
Maybe it is already there and your local Lensfun database is out of date.

If your camera or lens is missing even in the development version, 
please request an entry for your camera/lens using the <a href="https://github.com/lensfun/lensfun/issues">Issue Tracker</a>.
For new lenses the preferred way is to upload RAW images at <a href="http://wilson.bronger.org/calibration">Lensfun's calibration service</a>. 
Lensfun's database maintainer then can create a lens profile and add it to the database. If you provided your email address, a notification will be sent.

Alternatively, you can do the calibration yourself. 
Below is a list of several tutorials that can be used as an introduction. 
Which method you choose depends on your experience and on the effort you want to spend. 
Please upload your newly created profile to the <a href="https://github.com/lensfun/lensfun/issues">Issue Tracker</a> 
or send it to our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/lensfun/mailman/">Mailing List</a>.
Please also provide a few sample images to verify the profile. Then we will add it to the database.
